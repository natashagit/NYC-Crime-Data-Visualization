# NYC-Crime-Data-Visualization

This visualization aims to answer the following questions using the NYC crime dataset:

1. **Crime Prevalence by Type and Location**:  
   What types of crimes are most prevalent in NYC, and how does their distribution vary across different boroughs or neighborhoods?

2. **Demographic Patterns in Crime Victimization**:  
   Are certain crime types more common within specific age groups or genders?

These questions provide insight into crime patterns and help identify vulnerable groups, guiding potential policy interventions or resource allocation by law enforcement.

This clustered bubble map offers a dynamic way to explore NYC crime data, with interactive filters aiding in understanding crime prevalence across demographics and locations. Using filters in combination allows for an in-depth, layered analysis, such as examining theft incidents involving young males in specific neighborhoods or harassment cases reported by females under 18. This multi-dimensional approach not only highlights the distribution of crime types across the city but also identifies vulnerable demographic groups, supporting a nuanced understanding of urban crime dynamics. Each filter thus contributes to answering the visualizationâ€™s primary questions by isolating variables and revealing relationships between crime type, victim demographics, and geographic distribution.
